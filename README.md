Exploring Titanic: Unveiling the 'Women and Children First' Narrative Through Data Analysis

This repository contains an in-depth exploration and analysis of the Titanic disaster dataset. The primary goal of this project is to delve into the survival patterns aboard the Titanic, particularly investigating the widely discussed "women and children first" protocol during the evacuation.

## Overview

This project serves as a learning journey in data science and analysis. As a beginner, I undertook this project to gain a deeper understanding of data handling, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and model comparison.

## Key Objectives

- Investigate survival rates among different demographic categories.
- Explore age-based distinctions in survival chances.
- Validate or challenge the historical principle of "women and children first."
- Utilize various data science techniques and models to analyze the Titanic dataset.
- Document the process for personal learning and future reference.

## Contents

1. **Introduction**: Overview of the project objectives and key questions addressed.
2. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: Steps involved in cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
3. **Analysis of Passenger Categories**: Investigation into survival proportions among different passenger groups.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Application of logistic regression models to understand survival probabilities.
5. **Conclusion**: Summary of findings, insights, and future recommendations.
6. **Future Recommendations and Further Investigations**: Suggestions for future studies and potential next steps.
